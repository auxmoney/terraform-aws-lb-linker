# AWS LB-Linker Terraform Module 

Terraform module adapted from [this AWS blog post][1]. In short, gives you the ability
to associate a static IP address with an Applicaion Load Balancer (ALB)
using a Network Load Balancer (NLB). This module consists of a Lambda
that periodically runs and resolves the ALB's private IP addresses and
attaches them to the NLB.
